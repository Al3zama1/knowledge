## Network
A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes such as clients and servers to share resources through an infrastructure made up of network-specific devices like routers and switches.
## Client
A client is a devices that accesses a service made available by a server.
## Server
A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.
## Switch
The primary responsibility of switches is to facilitate switching, a process that enables the sharing of resources within a network. Switches connect multiple devices within the same Local Area Network (LAN), allowing efficient communication between hosts. Switches do not provide connectivity between different LANs or access to the internet. They typically feature many network interfaces-often 24 or more-to support connections for numerous end devices.
## Router
They primary functionality of routers is routing, which is the process of sharing resources between networks. Unlike switches, which provide connectivity for devices within a single LAN, routers facilitate communicate between LANs. Furthermore, they feature far less network interfaces than switches do.
## Firewall
Firewalls are specialized network security devices designed to monitor and control traffic entering and leaving a network. They act as hardware-based filters between networks and can be deployed inside or outside a network perimeter. Firewalls enforce security policies by analyzing traffic according to predefined rules. When enhanced with advanced inspection and filtering features, they are commonly referred to as **Next-Generation Firewalls**.

Another type of firewall is known as **host-based firewall**. This is a software application installed on an individual host, such as a computer or server, that filters network traffic entering and leaving that device. Even in networks protected by a hardware firewall, host-based firewalls should be used to provide an additional layer of security and act as an extra line of defense.
