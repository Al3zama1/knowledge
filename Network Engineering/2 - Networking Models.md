A **networking model** refers to a collection of documents. Each document specifies a small function required for a network. Collectively, they define everything that should happen for a computer network to work. Some documents might define protocols, which are rules that devices must follow to communicate. Other documents might specify physical requirement for networking, like voltage and current levels. In short, a networking model establishes a blueprint that vendors can follow to ensure their devices interoperate with other devices following the same specification.
## Open Systems Interconnection(OSI)
 The OSI networking model was the first attempt to create a model that could be widely adopted by all vendors, thereby increasing interoperability among multi-vendor networking devices. Before this, vendors created and used their own networking models, which led to multiple models and the need to learn more than one, especially when working with networks that contained devices from different vendors. Although the OSI model has been completely replaced by TCP/IP, today’s dominant networking model, its concepts and terminology remain critical for understanding modern networks. 
### OSI Architecture
The OSI networking model is divided into seven distinct layers. Each layer contains different protocols and standards responsible for a specific function in the overall network communication process.

#### Application Layer
The application layer serves as an interface between end-user applications and the underlying network services they need to effectively communicate with each other and with servers over the network. Examples of protocols operating at this layer include Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web browsing, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for file transfers, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email services, and Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
#### Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is responsible for translating data between the application layer and network formats. Additionally, it performs tasks such as compression, decompression, encryption, decryption, and data formatting. This ensures data readability at the application layer across different systems.
#### Session Layer
The job of the session layer is to manage and control sessions between computers that communicate with each other.  Therefore, it initiates, manages, and terminates connections to ensure efficient data exchange and session recovery after interruptions.
#### Transport Layer
The transport layer provides end-to-end communication services for applications. Furthermore, port numbers are introduced at this layer as a way to ensure data reaches the intended process among all the different processes running on the same computer. Examples of protocols operating at this layer include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol, which are used for data transmission. TCP is connection-oriented and emphasizes reliable data transmission with error recovery and flow control at the cost of reduced performance. On the other hand, UDP is connectionless and offers faster data transmission at the cost of reliability.
#### Network Layer
The network layer is responsible for determining the best physical path for data to reach its destination based on factors such as network conditions and priority of service. Key protocols at this layer include the Internet Protocol (IP), which is used for routing and addressing of network devices, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for diagnostic and error-reporting purposes, and dynamic routing protocols for the automatic discovery and management of routing destinations.
#### Data Link Layer
The Data Link layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer with the help of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, which are used to reliably deliver data to only one, multiple, or all devices on a local network segment. Examples of protocols at this layer include, Ethernet (802.3) for data transmission over Local Area Networks (LANs), Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for direct connection between two nodes, and Wifi (802.11) for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). It also includes mechanisms for detecting and possibly correcting errors that may occur in the physical layer. 
#### Physical Layer
They physical layer defines the physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices, such as cabling and energy. Examples of physical mediums include fiber cables, Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cables, and radio signals.
### OSI Data Encapsulation 
Each OSI layer adds a header, and sometimes a trailer, to the data from the layer above as it travels from the top layer to the bottom layer and out onto the network. This process is called **encapsulation**. Conversely, when the data reaches its intended recipient and moves from the bottom layer to the top layer, the headers and trailers are removed. This process is called **de-encapsulation**.

OSI uses Protocol Data Units (PDU) to refer to its messages.  A PDU represents the bits that include headers, and trailers for a particular layer, as well as the encapsulated data.
### Same-Layer vs Adjacent-Layer Interactions
Each OSI layer requests services from the layer below it. To provide these services, each layer adds a header, and sometimes a trailer, to the data from the layer above. The process by which layers on the same device interact and provide services to one another is called **adjacent-layer interaction**, while **same-layer interaction** refers to the logical communication between layers at the same level on different devices.

## Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
The TCP/IP networking model is the most widely used model in the networking industry today. It incorporates many of the same concepts as the OSI model, including encapsulation, de-encapsulation, adjacent-layer interaction, same-layer interaction, and a layered architecture, with a few key differences.
### OSI and TCP/IP Layer Names and Numbers Comparison
The TCP/IP networking model incorporates the same conceptual layers as the OSI model, although some layers have different names and others are combined into a single layer.

Even though the world uses TCP/IP today rather than OSI, it is common practice to use the numbering from the OSI layer. For example, when referring to an application layer protocol in a TCP/IP network, the world still refers to the protocol as a layer 7 protocol. Furthermore, while TCP/IP includes more functions at its application layer, OSI breaks those into session, presentation, and application layers.  Again, people usually refer to the application layer in a TCP/IP network as layers 5 - 7, using the OSI numbering.
### TCP/IP Data Encapsulation
Similar to the OSI networking model, TCP/IP also encapsulates data as it travels down the layers and de-encapsulates data as it travels up the layers. The only difference is the amount of layers the data travels through and the **Protocol Data Units (PDUs)** names.
